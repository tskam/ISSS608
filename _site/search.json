I will post one or two data visualisation and you are required to\r\ncritic, suggest ways for improvement and rework the data visualisation.\r\nMaybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the\r\ndata. I am curious to see the different approaches you all take.\r\nThe purpose of the makeover is to improve on the original\r\nvisualisation. Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things\r\ndon’t work, and how you made it better. You should try stick to the\r\nfields in the data set provided and improve upon the original\r\nvisualisation. However, if supplementing the data helps you tell a\r\nbetter story, go for it!\r\nDataViz Makeover Topics\r\nDataViz Makeover 1\r\nDataViz Makeover 2\r\nSubmission Instructions\r\nThe write-up of the DataViz Makeover must be in distill\r\nor blogdown\r\nformat.

Drawing from research and practice on Data Visualisation,\r\nHuman-Computer Interaction, Data Analytics, Data Mining and Usability\r\nEngineering, this course aims to share with you how visual analytics\r\ntechniques can be used to interact with data from various sources and\r\nformats, explore relationship, ’‘’detect the expected and discover the\r\nunexpected’’’ without having to deal with complex statistical formulas\r\nand programming.\r\nThe goals of this course are:\r\nTo share with you the principles, best practices and methods of\r\nvisual analytics\r\nTo provide you hands-on experiences in using\r\ncommercial-off-the-shelf visual analytics software and programming tools\r\nto design visual analytics applications\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nUpon successful completion of the course, students will be able\r\nto:\r\nUnderstand the basic concepts, theories and methodologies of visual\r\nanalytics.\r\nAnalyse data using appropriate visual thinking and visual analytics\r\ntechniques.\r\nPresent data using appropriate visual communication and graphical\r\nmethods.\r\nDesign and implement cutting-edge visual analytics system for\r\nsupporting decision making.\r\nCompetencies\r\nExplaining the concepts and principles of Visual Analytics.\r\nDescribing the differences between Visual Analytics, Data\r\nVisualisation, Statistical Graphs and Infographics.\r\nExplaining the basic concept of visual variables and applying these\r\nconcepts and best practices in designing data-driven static graphs.\r\nExplaining interactive techniques and best practices, and applying\r\nthese techniques in designing interactive data visualisation.\r\nUnderstanding the data characteristics of numerical data and\r\nbuilding data visualisation by using appropriate visually driven\r\nunivariate and bivariate data analytics methods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of multivariate data and building\r\ndata visualisation by using appropriate multivariate visualisation\r\nmethods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of time-series data and building\r\ndata visualisation by using appropriate time-series visualisation\r\nmethods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of geographical data and building\r\ndata visualisation by using appropriate geovisualisation methods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of network data and building data\r\nvisualisation by using appropriate network graph visualisation\r\nmethods.\r\nExplain the concepts and principles of Information Dashboard.\r\nBuilding analytical dashboard by using Commercial off-the-shelf\r\n(COTS) software.\r\nDesigning visual analytics application programmatically by using\r\nfree and open source software and packages.\r\nBasic Modules\r\nThis course comprises ten integrated components as shown below:\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\nThere are no prerequisites for the class. However, students taking\r\nthis course must be willing to learn R programming framework. For\r\nstudents who are new to R, you are encouraged to consult the following\r\nresources prior to the lesson starts:\r\nGarrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham (2020) R for Data Science. This book is\r\nhighly recommended to anybody who are interested to understand how to do\r\n’‘’Modern Data Science’’’ by using ’‘’tidyverse’’’ principles and\r\nmethods.\r\n王敏杰 数据科学中的\r\nR 语言.\r\nYou don’t have to finish reading either one of them before lesson\r\nstarts. Take your time, review them from time to time. You will find\r\nyourself learning something new each time you revisit the book.\r\nCourse Assessment\r\nThe assessment for this course consists of four major components,\r\nnamely:\r\nIn-class Hands-on exercise and class participation,\r\nDataViz Makeover\r\nTake-home exercises,\r\nVisual Analytics Project.\r\nThere will be no mid-term test or final examination for this\r\ncourse.\r\nIn-class Exercise and\r\nClass Participation\r\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the\r\nassigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to\r\nclass. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical\r\ninformation and from provided documents and articles on business\r\napplications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the\r\nrecommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without\r\npreparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful.\r\nStudent sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of\r\nassigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the\r\nlearning in this course.\r\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on\r\nexercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are\r\nguided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides\r\nwill be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson,\r\nstudents are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for\r\nreviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection.\r\nStudents will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise,\r\n7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if\r\nabsent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\r\nTake-home Exercise\r\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to\r\nrevise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had\r\nlearned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is\r\ndesigned to be completed within 1.5-2 hours. The exercise is not a\r\nrepetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be\r\ninnovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design\r\nenlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics\r\npurposes.\r\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming\r\nissues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise.\r\nHowever, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home\r\nexercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is\r\nstrictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism\r\nand submission of work that is not the student’s\r\nVisual Analytics Project\r\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students with first hand\r\nexperiences on collecting, processing and analysing large business data\r\nusing real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or\r\nimplementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in\r\nspecific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of\r\napplication development by integrating analytical tools within a visual\r\nanalytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research\r\ntopics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a\r\nconcrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and\r\ncreative solution.\r\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page.\r\nGrading Summary\r\nThe grading distribution of this course is as follows:\r\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation 20%\r\nTake-home Exercise 50%\r\nVisual Analytics Project 30%\r\nProject blog 15%\r\nPoster 10%\r\nPractice research paper 25%\r\nArtifact 50%\r\n\r\nThere will be no mid-term test and final examination for this\r\ncourse.\r\nWords of Encouragement\r\nFor the next 12 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy,\r\nespecially come to R programming\r\n\r\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new\r\nlanguage, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the\r\nchief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R\r\npackages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\r\n\r\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and\r\nthink, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to\r\nprogram.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets\r\nfrustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code.\r\nIt’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and\r\ngets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break,\r\ndo something fun, and then come back and try again later.\r\n\r\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads\r\nagainst seemingly intractable errors.\r\n\r\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head\r\nagainst a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates,\r\nand don’t hesitate to approach me.\r\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who\r\ndon’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and\r\nwe should help each other to learn.\r\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try\r\nand help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint\r\nwhat you are struggling with.\r\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect\r\nprogrammer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been\r\nlearning new things almost every day.\r\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to\r\nlearn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\r\n\r\nCore Readings\r\nClaus.

All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of\r\nassessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of\r\nthe policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to\r\nexpulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. When in doubt,\r\nstudents should consult the instructors of the course. Details on the\r\nSMU Code of Academic Integrity may be accessed at http://www.smuscd.org/resources.html\r\nAccessibility and\r\nAccommodations\r\nSMU strives to make learning experiences accessible for all. If you\r\nanticipate or experience physical or academic barriers due to\r\ndisability, please let the instructor know immediately. You are also\r\nwelcome to contact the university’s disability support team if you have\r\nquestions or concerns about academic accommodations: included@smu.edu.sg\r\nPlease be aware that the accessible tables in our seminar room should\r\nremain available for students who require them.\r\nEmergency\r\nPreparedness for Teaching and Learning (EPTL)\r\nAs part of emergency preparedness, Instructors may conduct lessons\r\nonline via the WebEx platform during the term, to prepare students for\r\nonline learning. During an actual emergency, students will be notified\r\nto access the WebEx platform for their online lessons. The class\r\nschedule will mirror the current face-to-face class timetable unless\r\notherwise stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It aims to democratize data and analytics.\r\nHence, the application focuses and emphasises on\r\ninteractivity and effective integration of techniques\r\nfrom data analytics and data\r\nvisualization.\r\nA project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual\r\nanalytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains.\r\nAlternatively, a project may be in the form of application development\r\nby integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment.\r\nStudents are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to\r\ntheir field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics\r\nproblem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\r\nProject Topic\r\nThis term the topic of Visual Analytics Project will be based on VAST Challenge 2022.\r\nThe are three challenges provided. Teams are required to choose\r\none of the Challenge and build a Shiny Application to\r\nanswer the questions of the Challenge.\r\nProject Management\r\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project\r\nteam of 2-3 members by the first week of the academic\r\nterm.\r\nA good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well\r\ndefined sub-modules. Each sub-module should be the responsibility of one\r\nperson and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for\r\nwhether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is\r\ngreater than the sum of its parts!\r\nEach project team are required to maintain a comprehensive\r\nMinutes of Meeting from the beginning of the project until the\r\nend of the project. Each minutes of meeting should include but not limit\r\nto the discussion, disagreements, and consensus made and action items\r\nagreed within the team. The Minutes of Meeting should also record the\r\ndivision of labour and the considerations involved in the decision\r\nmade.\r\nThe following links provided useful guides on how to prepare the\r\nminutes of a meeting:\r\nHow\r\nto Write Meeting Minutes: Examples + Best Practices\r\nHow\r\nTo Write Effective Meeting Minutes(with Templates and Samples)\r\nThe Minutes of Meeting must be uploaded on eLearn within 24hrs after\r\nthe meeting ended.\r\nProject Milestone\r\nBrainstorming project ideas and consulting with course instructor\r\nanytime from week 1 onward.\r\nEditing and publishing project proposal latest by the end of the\r\nrecess week.\r\nSubmission of final application, user guide, project poster and\r\nartifacts: 3rd July 2022 by 11:59pm (mid-night)\r\nProject Deliverables\r\nProject Github\r\nAt the beginning of the project, project teams are required to create\r\na project Github. The project Github should include all the materials\r\nused to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal,\r\nposter and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a\r\ncomplete project version control including the application and project\r\ndocuments. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By\r\nthe end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of\r\nthe Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The\r\nGithub link also must be provided on eLearn.\r\nProject Website\r\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using\r\ndistill for RMarkdown.\r\nIt will be disseminated by using webserver such as Netfity.\r\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the project\r\nwebsite that includes:\r\nThe title of your project,\r\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the\r\nmotivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are\r\ngoing to build, and\r\nThe project proposal. This should in a webpage (remember to provide\r\na link at the wiki).\r\nProject proposal\r\nEach project teams must start thinking about their project ideas\r\nafter the first lesson. They are expected to discuss their project topic\r\nand scope of works with the instructor during the recess week. A project\r\nproposal in the form website edited using distill for\r\nRMarkdown on Netfily will be\r\nprepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by 15th May\r\n2022.\r\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project,\r\nproblems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related\r\nwork, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and\r\nearly prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage\r\nof this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the\r\nproject from their peers.\r\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the\r\ndetails including the final application, user guide and poster by\r\n3rd July 2022.\r\nPoster\r\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It\r\nshould include, but not limited to the following information:\r\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and\r\nproblems your project addresses.\r\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are\r\ninteresting and what make them difficult to solve.\r\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used\r\nto solve the problem.\r\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you\r\nbuilt.\r\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be\r\nextended.\r\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International\r\nStandards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\r\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\r\nResolution = 300dpi or above\r\nFile format = jpeg or pdf\r\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\r\nProject teams are encouraged to use posterdown to\r\ndesign your poster.\r\nNote: The poster will be considered a final\r\ndeliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design and data\r\nvisualisation principles and best practice to your poster.\r\nFinal Deliverables\r\nThe final deliverable will include:\r\nDeployment of the Web-enabled Visual Analytics Application on shinyapps.io\r\nby RStudio.\r\nartifact including the ShinyApp codes, data and all r modules.\r\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation\r\nfunctions designed.\r\nSample\r\nUserGuide 1\r\nSample\r\nUserGuide 2\r\n\r\nproject poster\r\nMinutes of Meeting\r\nThe final deliverable must be uploaded into the Dropbox of e-Learn\r\n(e.g. LMS). It must in a single zip file format.\r\nGrading\r\nThe visual analytics project will account for 30% of your final grade\r\nin the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project\r\nare as follows:\r\nProject website 20%\r\nPoster 15%\r\nMinutes of Meeting 15%\r\nShinyApp 50%\r\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea\r\n(If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it\r\naddresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the\r\nresearch, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\r\nGrading criteria for poster\r\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\r\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\r\nClear communication of design approaches\r\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\r\nCraft quality of the solution\r\nSample Projects\r\nNote that the following examples are for references purposes.
