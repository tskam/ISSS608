I will post one or two data visualisation and you are required to critic, suggest ways for improvement and rework the data visualisation. Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. I am curious to see the different approaches you all take.\r\nThe purpose of the makeover is to improve on the original visualisation. Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things don’t work, and how you made it better. You should try stick to the fields in the data set provided and improve upon the original visualisation.

Drawing from research and practice on Data Visualisation, Human-Computer Interaction, Data Analytics, Data Mining and Usability Engineering, this course aims to share with you how visual analytics techniques can be used to interact with data from various sources and formats, explore relationship, ’‘’detect the expected and discover the unexpected’’’ without having to deal with complex statistical formulas and programming.\r\nThe goals of this course are:\r\nTo share with you the principles, best practices and methods of visual analytics\r\nTo provide you hands-on experiences in using commercial-off-the-shelf visual analytics software and programming tools to design visual analytics applications\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nUpon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:\r\nUnderstand the basic concepts, theories and methodologies of visual analytics.\r\nAnalyse data using appropriate visual thinking and visual analytics techniques.\r\nPresent data using appropriate visual communication and graphical methods.\r\nDesign and implement cutting-edge visual analytics system for supporting decision making.\r\nCompetencies\r\nExplaining the concepts and principles of Visual Analytics.\r\nDescribing the differences between Visual Analytics, Data Visualisation, Statistical Graphs and Infographics.\r\nExplaining the basic concept of visual variables and applying these concepts and best practices in designing data-driven static graphs.\r\nExplaining interactive techniques and best practices, and applying these techniques in designing interactive data visualisation.\r\nUnderstanding the data characteristics of numerical data and building data visualisation by using appropriate visually driven univariate and bivariate data analytics methods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of multivariate data and building data visualisation by using appropriate multivariate visualisation methods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of time-series data and building data visualisation by using appropriate time-series visualisation methods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of geographical data and building data visualisation by using appropriate geovisualisation methods.\r\nUnderstanding the characteristics of network data and building data visualisation by using appropriate network graph visualisation methods.\r\nExplain the concepts and principles of Information Dashboard.\r\nBuilding analytical dashboard by using Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.\r\nDesigning visual analytics application programmatically by using free and open source software and packages.\r\nBasic Modules\r\nThis course comprises ten integrated components as shown below:\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\nThere are no prerequisites for the class. However, students taking this course must be willing to learn R programming framework. For students who are new to R, you are encouraged to consult the following resources prior to the lesson starts:\r\nGarrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham (2020) R for Data Science. This book is highly recommended to anybody who are interested to understand how to do ’‘’Modern Data Science’’’ by using ’‘’tidyverse’’’ principles and methods.\r\n王敏杰 数据科学中的 R 语言.\r\nYou don’t have to finish reading either one of them before lesson starts. Take your time, review them from time to time. You will find yourself learning something new each time you revisit the book.\r\nCourse Assessment\r\nThe assessment for this course consists of four major components, namely:\r\nIn-class Hands-on exercise and class participation,\r\nDataViz Makeover\r\nTake-home exercises,\r\nVisual Analytics Project.\r\nThere will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\r\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\r\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\r\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on exercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are guided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides will be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson, students are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for reviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection. Students will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise, 7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if absent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\r\nDataViz Makeover\r\nEach fortnight, I will post one or two data visualisation and you are required to critic, suggest ways for improvement and rework the data visualisation. Maybe you will be able to retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. I am curious to see the different approaches all of you take.\r\nThe purpose of the makeover is to improve on the original visualisation. Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things don’t work, and how you can make it better. You should try stick to the fields in the data set provided and improve upon the original visualisation. However, if supplementing the data helps you tell a better story, go for it!\r\nTake-home Exercise\r\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 1.5-2 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\r\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\r\nVisual Analytics Project\r\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students with first hand experiences on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\r\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page.\r\nGrading Summary\r\nThe grading distribution of this course is as follows:\r\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation 20%\r\nDataViz Makeover 30%\r\nTake-home Exercise 20%\r\nVisual Analytics Project 30%\r\nProject blog 15%\r\nPoster 10%\r\nPractice research paper 25%\r\nArtifact 50%\r\n\r\nThere will be no mid-term test and final examination for this course.\r\nWords of Encouragement\r\nFor the next 12 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming\r\n\r\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\r\n\r\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\r\n\r\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\r\n\r\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\r\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\r\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\r\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\r\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\r\n\r\nCore Readings\r\nClaus.

A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\r\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the first week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor before the end of Week 6. A project proposal in the form website edited using either blogdown or distill for RMarkdown on Netfily will be prepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by the end of Week 7.\r\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project, problems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.\r\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the details including the final application, user guide, poster, practice research paper by the end of week 14.\r\nProject Milestone\r\nBrainstorming project ideas and consulting with course instructor between Week 2 to Week 6.\r\nEditing and publishing project proposal by the end of Week 7.\r\nSubmission of final application, user guide, project poster, practice research paper and artifacts: 15th August 2021 by 11:59pm (mid-night)\r\nProject Deliverables\r\nProject Website\r\nProject Github\r\nAt the beginning of the project, project teams are required to create a project Github. The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\r\nProject Website\r\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using either blogdown or distill for RMarkdown. It will be disseminated by using webserver such as Netfity.\r\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\r\nThe title of your project,\r\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\r\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at the wiki).\r\nPoster\r\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\r\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\r\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\r\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\r\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\r\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\r\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\r\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\r\nResolution = 300dpi or above\r\nFile format = jpeg or pdf\r\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\r\nProject teams are encouraged to use posterdown to design your poster.\r\nNote: The poster will be considered a final deliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design and data visualisation principles and best practice to your poster.\r\nVisual Analytics Practice Research Paper\r\nThe research paper should be in the form of Visual Analytics Application practice and research. In particular it should contain the followings:\r\nMotivation of the application\r\nReview and critic on past works\r\nDesign framework - A detail description of the design principles used and data visualisation elements built (Refer to Section IV: Interface of this paper.\r\nDemonstration - Use case\r\nDiscussion - What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? A full blown user study is not expected, but informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.\r\nFuture Work - A description of how your system could be extended or refined.\r\nThe research paper should include an abstract of not more than 300 words. The actual research paper itself should not more than 6 pages excluding figures, tables, formula and references. The practice research paper must be edited by using R Markdown and the ACM: Association for Computing Machinery template of rticles should be used.\r\nSample practice research papers\r\nDIVAD: A Dynamic and Interactive Visual Analytical Dashboard for Exploring and Analyzing Transport Data\r\nMEPHAS: an interactive graphical user interface for medical and pharmaceutical statistical analysis with R and Shiny\r\nSpatialEpiApp: A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Disease Data\r\nDeveloping web-based data analysis tools for precision farming using R and Shiny\r\nEHDViz: clinical dashboard development using open-source technologies\r\nHealth Equity Assessment Toolkit\r\nInteractive Pharmacometric Applications Using R and the Shiny Package\r\nFinal Deliverables\r\nThe final deliverable will include:\r\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\r\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\r\nSample UserGuide 1\r\nSample UserGuide 2\r\n\r\nproject poster\r\na practice research paper\r\nThe final deliverable must be uploaded into the Dropbox of e-Learn (e.g. LMS). It must in a single zip file format.\r\nGrading\r\nThe visual analytics project will account for 30% of your final grade in the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows:\r\nProject website 15%\r\nPoster 10%\r\nPractice Research Paper 25%\r\nShinyApp 50%\r\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\r\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\r\nGrading criteria for poster\r\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\r\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\r\nClear communication of design approaches\r\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\r\nCraft quality of the solution\r\nSample Projects\r\nNote that the following examples are for references purposes. You are urge to use your own creativity and innovation to design the application\r\nMITB (Analytics)\r\nISSS608 Year 2013-14 Term 3B\r\nISSS608 Year 2014-15 Term 3B\r\nISSS608 Year 2015-16 Term 1\r\nOooh Shiny!\r\nKong Simi - A visual earpiece into the Singapore Parliament\r\n\r\nISSS608 Year 2016-17 Term 1\r\nProject A - The Non-Conventional Sales Dashboard for Company A\r\nDashboardViz\r\n\r\nISSS608 Year 2016-17 Term 3\r\nVRshiny: An Application for better business decision making - Visualizing Association Rules with Network Diagram in Shiny\r\nDiscovering traffic patterns by using network graph visualisations.

Like if the three members chose the same mini-challenge, they would need to pick the best part to combine in the project. And if the three members chose the three different mini-challenge, they would need to combine the three into one story in the final shiny app and the research paper.\r\n\r\nProf: Yes, the assignment should form the foundation of the project. \r\n\r\nQ2: Is there any difference in the visualisation requirements of the assignment and the project? Is shiny required for both the assignment and the project? Or we can do the assignment visualisation without the shiny?\r\n\r\nProf: For the assignment, RMarkdown should be used to prepare the answers. For the project, on the other hands, the web application should be builded by using Shiny.\r\n\r\nQ3: Are we only able to use R and R shiny in the assignment and the project? Can we use other tools in the data cleaning and the analysis?\r\n\r\nProf: You are expected to use R to complete the tasks given, including data import, integration, cleaning, wrangling and reporting.\r\n\r\nQ4: We chose mini-challenge 3 of the VAST challenge as our final project topic. During the exploration of data, we found that the data they provided is incomplete. From the file “MC3_data_readme” that describes the dataset of mini-challenge 3, it said that the data includes two types of records which are Microblog message and Call center data. However, the Call center data has not yet been provided. We also noticed that from the “Home” page of the VAST challenge website, they said, “VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2 is now available! Additional challenges will be available for download soon!”. It seems like we still need to wait for the complete data for mini-challenge 3. Could you please tell us should we keep waiting or choose the topic from the rest mini-challenges?\r\n\r\nProf: Not true. Both data are provided in the three csv files for MC3. Please check the data carefully.\r\n\r\nQ5: I’m a little bit confused about our final project scope. Could you please tell me that does our final project needs to choose from the three mini-challenge from VAST or we need to find the data by ourselves?\r\n\r\nProf: This term, the visual analytics project must use VAST Challenge 2021 case(s). You do not have to look for your own data.\r\n\r\nQ6: Do we need to find our own dataset? Or do we solely use the data from the mini challenge?\r\n\r\nProf: You should use the data sets provided for the mini challenge\r\n\r\nQ7: Understand that the project is supposed to be an integration of the assignments we have completed. Can we understand what is the difference between the project and assignment? Do we just simply combine all of the individual assignments?\r\n\r\nProf: No, for the assignment you will address the questions using appropriate R packages and RMarkdown and for the Project, you are required to design and build web application using Shiny and R packages.\r\n\r\nQ8: Do we have to come out with a draft project proposal before scheduling a consultation?\r\n\r\nProf: Yes, you should or else there is nothing to discuss\r\n\r\nProject Groups\r\nG1\r\nGroup 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nGroup 5\r\nGroup 6\r\nGroup 7\r\nGroup 8\r\nGroup 9\r\nGroup 10\r\nGroup 11\r\nGroup 12\r\nGroup 13\r\nGroup 14\r\nGroup 15\r\nGroup 16\r\nG2\r\nGroup 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nGroup 5\r\nGroup 6\r\nGroup 7\r\nGroup 8\r\nGroup 9\r\nGroup 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
