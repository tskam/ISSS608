## Limitation of Statistical Map: Maps lie!

Although both choropleth maps were created using the same variable (i.e. aged population) but the choropleth maps produced look very different.  This is because the choropleth maps were created using two different data classification methods.  For the choropleth map on the left, quantile classification method was used and for choropleth on the right, equal interval classification method was used.   

```{r echo=FALSE}
packages = c('sf', 'tmap', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
mpszpop2020 <- read_rds("data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds")
```


.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.height=4}
tm_shape(mpszpop2020)+
  tm_fill("AGED",
          n = 6,
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Extreme Value Maps

.vlarge[
- Extreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. 

- These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).

## Percentile Map

.pull-left[
.large[
+ The percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. 
+ The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). 
+ Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.

### Extracting a variable from an sf data frame

Step 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunl below.

```{r}
mpszpop2020a <- mpszpop2020 %>%
  drop_na()
```

Step 2:

```{r}
percent <- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)
var <- mpszpop2020a["DEPENDENCY"] %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)
quantile(var[,1], percent)
```

### Why Writing Functions?

.vlarge[
Writing a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:

- You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.
- As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.
- You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

## Box map

- Displaying summary statistics on a choropleth map by using the basic principles of boxplot.

![:scale 75%](img/image2.png)

- To create a box map, a custom breaks specification will be used. However, there is a complication. The break points for the box map vary depending on whether lower or upper outliers are present.

???
In essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast, when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the minimum value).

  lofence <- qv[2] - mult * iqr
  # initialize break points vector
  bb <- vector(mode="numeric",length=7)
  # logic for lower and upper fences
  if (lofence < qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers
    bb[1] <- lofence
    bb[2] <- floor(qv[1])
  } else {
    bb[2] <- lofence
    bb[1] <- qv[1]

    bb[7] <- upfence
    bb[6] <- ceiling(qv[5])
  } else {

## Choropleth Map for Rates

.pull-left[
.large[
In much of our readings we have now seen the importance to map rates rather than counts of things, and that is for the simple reason that population is not equally distributed in space. That means that if we do not account for how many people are somewhere, we end up mapping population size rather than our topic of interest.

### Raw rate map

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.retina=4, fig.height=5}

## Relative Risk Map

.pull-left[
- A commonly used notion in demography and public health analysis is the concept of a **standardized mortality rate** (SMR), sometimes also referred to as **relative risk** or **excess risk**. 
- The idea is to compare the observed mortality rate to a national (or regional) standard. More specifically, the observed number of events is compared to the number of events that would be expected had a reference risk been applied.
]

.pull-right[
Formally, this is expressed as:

.center[
![:scale 30%](img/image4.jpg)
]

which yields the expected number of events for each area i as:

.center[
![:scale 30%](img/image5.jpg)
]

The relative risk then follows as the ratio of the observed number of events (e.g., aged) over the expected number:
