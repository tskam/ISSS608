### Data & view specification
- **Visualise** data by choosing visual encodings.
- **Polaris** of Tableau

.center[
![:scale 60%](img/image3-5.jpg)]

---
### Data & view specification
- **Filter** out data to focus on relevant items.

.center[
![:scale 70%](img/image3-6.jpg)]

---
### Data & view specification
- **Slicer** is an axis-parallel selection tool, which selects a range along an axis, where the end-point of the interval can be modified dynamically.

---
### Data & view specification
- **Sort** items to expose patterns.

.center[
![:scale 60%](img/image3-7.jpg)]

---
### Data & view specification
- Hierarchical sorting

.center[
![:scale 60%](img/image3-8.jpg)]

---
### Data & view specification
- **Derive** values or models from source data.

---
## View Manipulation
### Selection functions
- **Pointer** selects a single object in a plot.

---
## View Manipulation
### Selection functions
- **Drag-box** selects a rectangular region in a box.

---
## View Manipulation
### Selection functions
.pull-left[
- **Brush** is a generalisation of the drag-box.  Once a rectangular region is define, the brush allows users to move that region across a plot and thus dynamically change the selected subset.

## View Manipulation
### Selection functions
- **Lasso** allows users to define an arbitrary contiguous shape to select data.

## View Manipulation
### Highlighting
- Selected records are highlighted.

.center[
![:scale 55%](img/image3-16.jpg)]

---
## View Manipulation
- **Navigate** to examine high-level patterns and low-level detail.
- Shneiderman’s mantra

.center[
![:scale 70%](img/image3-3.jpg)]

---
## View Manipulation
- The scatter plot provides an overview and the bar and line graphs provide detail sales and profits trends overtime.

.center[
![:scale 70%](img/image3-17.jpg)]

---
## View Manipulation
- **Coordinate** views for linked, multi-dimensional exploration

## View Manipulation

## View Manipulation
### Rotating
- Touring view with JMP’s 3D scatterplot

.center[
![:scale 35%](img/image3-20.jpg)]

---
## Process and Provenance

.large[
- Record analysis histories for revisitation, review and sharing.

- Annotate patterns to determine findings.

- Share views and annotations to enable collaboration.

- Guide users through analysis tasks or stories.

## Animation in Visual Analytics

.pull-left[
.large[
- The purpose of animation is to facilitate perception of changes when transitioning between related data graphics

- Do not confine to time-series data only

### Why using Animation in Visual Analytics

.large[
- Motion is highly effective at attracting attention.

- Animation facilitates object constancy for changing objects.

- Animated behaviours can give rise to perceptions of causality and intentionality, communicating cause-and-effect relationships and establishing narrative.

- Animation can be emotionally engaging, engendering increased interest or enjoyment.

### Principles of Animation

.pull-left[
- ***Congruence*** principle states that the structure and content of the external representation should correspond to the desired and content of the internal representation.

- Maintain valid data graphics during transitions

- Use consistent semantic-syntactic mappings

- Respect semantic correspondence

- Avoid ambiguity
]

.pull-right[
- ***Apprehension*** principle states that the structure and content of the external representation should be readily and accurately perceived and comprehended.

- Group similar transitions

- Minimise occlusion

- Maximise predictability

- Use simple transitions

- Use staging for complex transitions

- Make transitions as long as needed, but no longer
