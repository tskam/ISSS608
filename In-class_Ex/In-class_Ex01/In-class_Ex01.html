# Getting started
## Installing and loading the required libraries

.pull-left[
.large[
- Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed.  If yes, we will load the R pacakges.  If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

- The chunk code on the right will do the trick.

.pull-right[

```r
packages = c('tidyverse')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

## Importing data

.pull-left[
.large[
- The code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package.

- **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.


```r
exam_data &lt;- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```
]]

.pull-right[
.large[
- Year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.

- There are a total of seven attributes.  Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.
    - The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.
    - The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

## Then, why ggplot2

.pull-left[
.large[
The transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.

## Grammar of Graphics

.pull-left[
- Wilkinson, L. (1999) **Grammar of Graphics**, Springer.
- The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question: 

    ***What is a statistical graphic?***

- Grammar of graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematic and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.
- Two principles
    + Graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements
    + Meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping
]

.pull-right[
- A good grammar will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). 

- A grammar provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. 

- A grammar may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically
correct but nonsensical graphics.

# Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
.center[

.pull-left[
- **Data**: The dataset being plotted.
- **Aesthetics** take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.
- **Geometrics**: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.
- **Facets** split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).
- **Statistics**, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).
- **Coordinate systems** define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.
- **Themes** modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.]

### The *ggplot()* function and [*data*]() argument 

.pull-left[
.large[
- Let us call the *ggplot()* function using the code chunk on the right.

- Notice that a blank canvas appears.

- *ggplot()* initializes a ggplot object.

- The *data* argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting. 

- If the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by *fortify()*.

### The [Aesthetic mappings](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html)

.large[
- The aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency.

- Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.

- All aesthetics of a plot are specified in the [*aes()*](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html) function call (in later part of this lesson, you will see that each *geom* layer can have its own aes specification)]

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Geometric Objects: *geom* 

.pull-left[
- Geometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include: 
    + *geom_point* for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)
    + *geom_line* for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)
    + *geom_smooth* for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)
    + *geom_bar* for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)
    + *geom_histogram* for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)
    + *geom_polygon* for drawing arbitrary shapes
    + *geom_map* for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).
]

.pull-right[
![](img/image6.jpg)

- A plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the **+** operator.
- For complete list, please refer to [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Geometric Objects: [*geom_dotplot*](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_dotplot.html)

.pull-left[
In a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
* geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)
```

Note that y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading.]

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Geometric Objects: *geom_dotplot*

.pull-left[
The code chunk below performs the following two steps: 

- *scale_y_continuous()* is used to turn off the y-axis, and 
- binwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
* geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,
*              dotsize = 0.5) +
* scale_y_continuous(NULL,
*                    breaks = NULL)

.pull-left[
In the code chunk below, *geom_histogram()* is used to a simple histogram by using values in *MATHS* field of *exam_data*.


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
* geom_histogram()
```

- Note that the default bin is 30.

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Modifying a geometric object by changing *geom()*

.pull-left[
In the code chunk below, 

- *bins* argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,
- *fill* argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and 
- *color* argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
* geom_histogram(bins=20,
*                color="black",

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Modifying a geometric object by changing *aes()* 

.pull-left[
- The code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. *fill*) by using sub-group of *aesthetic()*.    


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
*          fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="grey30")
```

### Geometric Objects: [*geom-density*](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html)

.pull-left[
*geom-density()* computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram. 

It is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.

The code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +

.pull-left[
Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it's easier to compare several distributions since they're placed side by side.

The code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.


```r
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS,

- The Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary.  For example:
    + frequency of values of a variable (bar graph)
    + a mean
    + a confidence limit

- There are two ways to use these functions:
    + add a *stat_()* function and override the default geom, or
    + add a *geom_()*/ function and override the default stat.

### Facets

.large[
- Facetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. 

- Facets are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables.

- ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: *facet_grid* and *facet_wrap*.
]

---
## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### *facet_wrap()* 

.large[
- facet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d.

- This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.]

---

]

---
## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### *facet_grid()* function

.large[
- facet_grid forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. 

- It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.]

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Coordinates

.large[
- The *Coordinates* functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot.

- There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:

    + *coord_cartesian()*: the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).
    + *coord_flip()*: a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.
    + *coord_fixed()*: a cartesian system with a "fixed" aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a "widescreen" plot).
    + *coord_quickmap()*: a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.

## Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2
### Themes

.large[
- Themes control elements of the graph not related to the data.  For example:
    + background colour
    + size of fonts
    + gridlines
    + colour of labels
- Built-in themes include:
    + *theme_gray()* (default)
    + *theme_bw()*
    + *theme_classic()*
- A list of theme can be found at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html.
- Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).]

A simple vertical bar chart for frequency analysis.

Critics:
- y-aixs label is not clear (i.e. count)
- To support effective comparison, the bars should be sorted by their resepctive frequencies.
