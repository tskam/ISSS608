### Importing Multiple Text Files from Multiple Folders

.pull-left[

#### Step 1: Creating a folder list

```{r}
news20 <- "data/20news/"
```

#### Step 2: Define a function to read all files from a folder into a data frame

```{r}
read_folder <- function(infolder) {
  tibble(file = dir(infolder, 
                    full.names = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(text = map(file, 
                      read_lines)) %>%
    transmute(id = basename(file), 
              text) %>%
    unnest(text)
}
```
]

---
### Importing Multiple Text Files from Multiple Folders

.pull-left[
#### Step 3: Reading in all the messages from the 20news folder

```{r}
raw_text <- tibble(folder = 
                     dir(news20, 
                         full.names = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(folder_out = map(folder, 
                          read_folder)) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(folder_out)) %>%
  transmute(newsgroup = basename(folder), 
            id, text)
write_rds(raw_text, "data/rds/news20.rds")
```
]

.pull-right[
Things to learn from the code chunk above:
- [*read_lines()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_lines.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package is used to read up to n_max lines from a file.
- [*map()*](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) of [**purrr**](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package is used to transform their input by applying a function to each element of a list and returning an object of the same length as the input.
- [*unnest()*](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nest.html) of **dplyr** package is used to flatten a list-column of data frames back out into regular columns.
- [mutate()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) of **dplyr** is used to add new variables and preserves existing ones; 
- [transmute()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) of **dplyr** is used to add new variables and drops existing ones.
- [read_rds()](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) is used to save the extracted and combined data frame as rds file for future use.

### Initial EDA 

.pull-left[
Figure below shows the frequency of messages by newsgroup.

```{r echo=FALSE}
raw_text %>%
  group_by(newsgroup) %>%
  summarize(messages = n_distinct(id)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(messages, newsgroup)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(y = NULL)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
The code chunk:

```{r eval=FALSE}
raw_text <- news20
raw_text %>%
  group_by(newsgroup) %>%
  summarize(messages = n_distinct(id)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(messages, newsgroup)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(y = NULL)
```
]


---
## Introducing tidytext

- Using tidy data principles in processing, analysing and visualising text data.
- Much of the infrastructure needed for text mining with tidy data frames already exists in packages like 'dplyr', 'broom', 'tidyr', and 'ggplot2'.

Figure below shows the workflow using tidytext approach for processing and visualising text data.

### Cleaning Text Data

.pull-left[
#### Step 1: Removing header and automated email signitures

Notice that each message has some structure and extra text that we don’t want to include in our analysis. For example, every message has a header, containing field such as “from:” or “in_reply_to:” that describe the message. Some also have automated email signatures, which occur after a line like "--".

```{r}
cleaned_text <- raw_text %>%
  group_by(newsgroup, id) %>%
  filter(cumsum(text == "") > 0,
         cumsum(str_detect(
           text, "^--")) == 0) %>%
  ungroup()
```
]

.pull-right[
Things to learn from the code chunk:
- [*cumsum()*](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cumsum.html) of base R is used to return a vector whose elements are the cumulative sums of the elements of the argument.  
- [*str_detect()*](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_detect.html) from **stringr** is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string.
]

---
### Cleaning Text Data

.pull-left[
#### Step 2: Removing lines with nested text representing quotes from other users. 

In this code chunk below, regular expressions are used to remove with nested text representing quotes from other users. 

```{r}
cleaned_text <- cleaned_text %>%
  filter(str_detect(text, "^[^>]+[A-Za-z\\d]")
         | text == "",
         !str_detect(text, 
                     "writes(:|\\.\\.\\.)$"),
         !str_detect(text, 
                     "^In article <")
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
Things to learn from the code chunk: 

- [*str_detect()*](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_detect.html) from **stringr** is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string.
- [*filter()*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) of **dplyr** package is used to subset a data frame, retaining all rows that satisfy the specified conditions.
]

---
### Text Data Processing

.pull-left[
In this code chunk below, [*unnest_tokens()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidytext/versions/0.3.1/topics/unnest_tokens) of **tidytext** package is used to split the dataset into tokens, while [*stop_words()*](https://rdrr.io/cran/tidytext/man/stop_words.html) is used to remove stop-words. 

```{r}
usenet_words <- cleaned_text %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "[a-z']$"),
         !word %in% stop_words$word)
```
]

---
### Text Data Processing

.pull-left[
Now that we’ve removed the headers, signatures, and formatting, we can start exploring common words. For starters, we could find the most common words in the entire dataset, or within particular newsgroups.

```{r}
usenet_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Instead of counting individual word, you can also count words within by newsgroup by using the code chunk below.


```{r}
words_by_newsgroup <- usenet_words %>%
  count(newsgroup, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
```
]

---
### Visualising Words in newsgroups

.pull-left[
In this code chunk below, *wordcloud()* of **wordcloud** package is used to plot a static wordcloud.

```{r}
wordcloud(words_by_newsgroup$word,
          words_by_newsgroup$n,
          max.words = 300)

```
]

.pull-right[
A DT table can be used to complement the visual discovery.

```{r echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(words_by_newsgroup, 
              filter = 'top') %>% 
  formatStyle(0, target = 'row', 
              lineHeight='25%')
```
]

---
### Visualising Words in newsgroups

.pull-left[
The wordcloud below is plotted by using [**ggwordcloud**](https://lepennec.github.io/ggwordcloud/) package.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

words_by_newsgroup %>%
  filter(n > 5) %>%
ggplot(aes(label = word,
           size = n)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~newsgroup)
```
]

--
.pull-left[
The code chunk used:

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

words_by_newsgroup %>%
  filter(n > 0) %>%
ggplot(aes(label = word,
           size = n)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~newsgroup)
```
]

## Basic Concept of TF-IDF

- [tf–idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection of [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus). 

.center[
![:scale 60%](img/image10-4.jpg)
]

---
### Computing tf-idf within newsgroups

.pull-left[
The code chunk below uses *bind_tf_idf()* of tidytext to compute and bind the term frequency, inverse document frequency and ti-idf of a tidy text dataset to the dataset.   

```{r}
tf_idf <- words_by_newsgroup %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, newsgroup, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```
]

---
### Visualising tf-idf as interactive table

Table below is an interactive table created by using *datatable()*.

```{r echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(tf_idf, filter = 'top') %>% 
  formatRound(columns = c('tf', 'idf', 'tf_idf'), 
              digits = 3) %>%
  formatStyle(0, 
              target = 'row', 
              lineHeight='25%')
```

---
### Visualising tf-idf as interactive table

.pull-left[
The code chunk below uses *datatable()* of DT package to create a html table that allows pagination of rows and columns.

```{r eval=FALSE}
DT::datatable(tf_idf, filter = 'top') %>% 
  formatRound(columns = c('tf', 'idf', 
                          'tf_idf'), 
              digits = 3) %>%
  formatStyle(0, 
              target = 'row', 
              lineHeight='25%')
```
]

.pull-right[
Things to learn from the code chunk:
- *filter* argument is used to turn control the filter UI.
- *formatRound()* is used to customise the values format.  The argument *digits* define the number of decimal places.
- *formatStyle()* is used to customise the output table.  In this example, the arguments *target* and *lineHeight* are used to reduce the line height by 25%.

### Visualising tf-idf within newsgroups

.pull-left[
Facet bar charts technique is used to visualise the tf-idf values of science related newsgroup.

```{r echo=FALSE}
tf_idf %>%
  filter(str_detect(newsgroup, "^sci\\.")) %>%
  group_by(newsgroup) %>%
  slice_max(tf_idf, n = 12) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tf_idf, word, fill = newsgroup)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ newsgroup, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "tf-idf", y = NULL)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
The code chunk used to prepare the plot.

```{r eval=FALSE}
tf_idf %>%
  filter(str_detect(newsgroup, "^sci\\.")) %>%
  group_by(newsgroup) %>%
  slice_max(tf_idf, 
            n = 12) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, 
                        tf_idf)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tf_idf, 
             word, 
             fill = newsgroup)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ newsgroup, 
             scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "tf-idf", 
       y = NULL)
```
]

### Counting and correlating pairs of words with the widyr package

- To count the number of times that two words appear within the same document, or to see how correlated they are. 
- Most operations for finding pairwise counts or correlations need to turn the data into a wide matrix first.
- [**widyr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/widyr/index.html) package first ‘casts’ a tidy dataset into a wide matrix, performs an operation such as a correlation on it, then re-tidies the result. 

.pull-left[
![](img/image10-2.jpg)
]

--
.pull-right[
In this code chunk below, *pairwise_cor()* of **widyr** package is used to compute the correlation between newsgroup based on the common words found. 

```{r}
newsgroup_cors <- words_by_newsgroup %>%
  pairwise_cor(newsgroup, 
               word, 
               n, 
               sort = TRUE)
```
]

---
### Visualising correlation as a network

.pull-left[
Now, we can visualise the relationship between newgroups in network graph as shown below.

  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = correlation, 
                     width = correlation)) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, 
                  color = "lightblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name),
                 color = "red",
                 repel = TRUE) +
  theme_void()
```
